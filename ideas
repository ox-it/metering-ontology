Classes
-------

Meter (a physical device)

Metering (physical device X thing being metered X what is downstream)

LogicalMetering (a set of set operations on MeteringPoint)

Quantities being measured (Metrics)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Metric
InstantaneousMetric
CumulativeMetric

Voltage / potential difference (V) (probably wants defining (peak-to-peak?) I don't know enough)
Current (A)
Cumulative electricity usage (KWh (or Ws?))
Instantaneous power draw (KW)

Cumulative usage (m^3)
Flow (m^3/s)
Pressure (Pa)

Temperature (C)
Wind speed (ms^-1)
Cumulative rain fall (m)
Relative humidity (%)
Cloud cover (% (?))

Data in / out (bytes)
Throughput (bytes/s)

Relationships

excludes (for use with logical meters. e.g. an OUCS logical meter includes Trans A+B, excludes the meter on No21)
